void main() {
// Question 13
//  What will be the output of this code snippet? Explain your answer: ```dart void
//  main() { int x = 5; int y = x + 2 * 3; print(y); } ```
  //-----------------------
  int x = 5; //we declared a variable named x that holds an integer value = 5
  int y = x + 2 * 3; //we declared variable named y that has an equation
  print(y); // here it wil print 11 as for the operator precedence multiplication will happen first then addition so
  // it will be 5 + 6 = 11.
}
